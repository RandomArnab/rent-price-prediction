# rent-price-prediction
Want to create an app which runs automatically and stores data on the cloud and then gives a price range of rent as per as the user needs.
So, the rent data from every Indian metropolitan city is being scraped via Scrapy off of a site https://www.makaan.com/. Now i want to store this data in cloud via Scrapy's own Zyte and then build an ML model on it. 
Then create a Javascript app for which i need to learn JS.... sigh. Just a work in progress for now.
